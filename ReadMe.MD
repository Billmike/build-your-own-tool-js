## Build your own tool (Javascript version)

This project is heavily inspired by [John Crickett's Coding Challenge](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) series, where you build your own version of popular applications using your favorite languages. By deliberately practising the act of writing code, you improve your skills as a software developer.

The purpose of this project is to keep track of my progress as I go along the challenge. We'd focus on Javascript for this series, but my plan is to extend it to use other programming languages I am familiar with.
